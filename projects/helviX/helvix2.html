        <h5>SaaS B2B White label for steel centers</h5>
        <p>
          helviX wants to provide the steel service centers with a customized
          sales software With order management, online shop and document
          management.

            <h3 >From a single and complex file to a kanban like structure</h3>
            <p>
              By creating a kanban-like structure using Figma Teams, I started by
              helping helviX move away from a single design file to an easier and
              lightweight way to look and work with design mockups.

        <p class="right-item">
          The results were good, the separation of topics made it easier to
          navigate and find what we were looking for. Loading files and navigating
          was free of lag and overload. The files with the handoff designs were
          free of clutter.

            <h3>Quotes & Dynamic quotes</h3>
            <p>
                One of the main features of helviX platform is the Quote feature were
                the steel dealer makes an offer to the buyer request. To reduce the
                back-and-forth emails this feature helps the buyer to accept and decline
                the quote or even further accept only certain articles from the quote.

            <h3 >Additional Costs</h3>
            <p>
                As in every industry where logistics happen, we have additional costs
                besides the products we‚Äôre buying. After some creative iterations we
                found that keeping it simple and invoice-like was the best way to
                display these costs to the users.

          <h3>Blanket Orders</h3>
          <p>
            The steel industry has these annual contracts that the buyers and
            sellers set up. We‚Äôve revamped the interface and experience where these
            contracts are shown to enable the users to look for articles inside
            those contracts easier and effortlessly, just like they do for regular
            shop articles. <br><br>Previously we had only a visualization of the contracts
            with the materials inside, but after listening to the users we‚Äôve
            learned that having a shop view of these materials would help the users
            to find materials that they had already negotiated with the seller to
            purchase on a fixed rate.
