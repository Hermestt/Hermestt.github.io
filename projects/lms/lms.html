            <h2>How was the journey?</h2>
            <p>
                The map pointed us to a path where we would have to provide the necessary tools to transform the medium where the study is practiced e not the way it is practiced. In that sense, we idealized and developed tools like underlining, note taking, organized the interface for an easy navigation throughout content, access to exercise templates and vehicles of direct communication between students and tutors.
            </p>
            <p  >
               In reverse, we also developed tools that would allow the teacher to have direct contact with their classes, in a way that allows them to know where their students are having trouble or different behaviour between content and groups.<br>
               As in the conventional system, the desire of having the possibility to of students to have exercises where the evaluation of the answer wasn't determined by the input of the teacher by the system but rather by the tutor himself according to the interpretation of the student. That means we've created a vehicle where the students resolution travels to the ideal teacher and then the evaluation is made by himself.
            </p>
            <p>
               Since not all of the content falls from the sky, neither is transferred from a medium to another by pure desire, we've created a complex service that allows the creation, management, update, sharing and co-operation on the creation of learning content. In this way the contents are chosen and share by the tutors with their students.

            <h2>Tasks and Actions</h2>
            <h4>Specification documents</h4>
            <p>
               Developed specification documents, with the intent to communicate with all team-members and interested ones the objective we wanted to achieve.
               Documents like this are necessary for transparency, unification and agreement by the team and their target to hit.
            </p>
            <p>
               Additionally, there would be detailed the necessities in what regards about information and tecnological tools to achieve the missions. In this way it'd help the development team to have clarity in the data and abilities they would need to give to the system.
            </p>

            <h4>Content is King</h4>
            <p>
               The determination of content that'll be presented and its hierarchy that it defines is of extreme importance and needs scrutinisation since stage one.
               My approach to this is to collect the content and understand the levels of importance and how I can best show them in the interface providing a clean and easy readability of those contents.
            </p>

            <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
            <p>
               Since content is king, its organization and place to be is the queen.
               I've helped to organize Information Architecture on the project in a way that things have their specific place to be and be easier to reach.

            <h4>Design of Wireframes and High-Fidelity</h4>
            <p>
               To help me visually demonstrate my contribution and strategies set by the team I've used <a href="">Sketch</a>, <a href="">GitLab</a>, <a href="">GitHub</a>, <a href="">Zeplin</a>, <a href="">HTML</a>, <a href="">CSS</a> and <a href="">JS</a>.</p>

            <h4>Prototyping</h4>
            <p>
               In the desire of confirming the path we were following or simply to test ideas I've developed prototypes trough skecth and sometimes with videos.
            </p>

            <!---- ########################### ---->

            <h4>User Interviews</h4>
            <p>
               The mission of the products is to help the users reach their end goal and provide value. In that way the user feedback was information that helped us to refine our solutions and to better understand the users needs.
               </p>

            <!---- ########################### ---->

            <h4>Design Systems</h4>
            <p>
               Due to the size, complexity, capacity and necessity of scalability of the project, the integration of a Design System was one of the best decisions taken. Having this concept and toolkit at our disposal allowed the concentration of resources in conceptualization, ideation of solutions, development of high-fidelity designs in much lesser time and at the same time reducing the effort of the developer when building pages giving them the possibility to spend resources on refinement of functionalities.</p>

            <p>
                Communication is Key. English was the language.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>
               This was my first big professional project as Designer and with it I've learn about the reality of project management & development, the necessity of having everyone one the same level and co-operation. The reality of digital products and how they interact with the "real-world".
            </p>
            <p>
                Reality is something that we can only recognize when we are in her presence and I found that a determining factor to take most out of "her" is our capacity of abstraction and resolution. In this case, the differences between a digital and conventional learning system are quite uneven, but at the same time extension of each other. 
                Reality is something that we can only recognize when we are in her presence, and I found that a determining factor to take most out of "her" is our capacity of abstraction and resolution. In this case, the differences between a digital and conventional learning system are quite uneven, but at the same time extension of each other.
                In the conventional teaching, we have physical presence of a guide and partners with approximately the same knowledge as we in a specific class, on the digital medium this also exists but the physical separation can provide a low quality communication between everyone. This refers to take doubts, questions about how to use the tools we have in front of us and psychologically speaking a possible disruption on self-confidence and capacity to proceed the desired path when the user cannot use the tool as it should. To minimize the damages cause by this physical separation, the tool has to be a guide and the means of communication have to exist in order to bring harmony between the stepping in and out of the two mediums.
            </p>

            <p>
                The digital medium is an extention of the physical medium.
            </p>

            <p>
                As far as events can go it was notable the elevation of my abilities of ideation, visualization, communication and capacity to manage resources and priorities. The team factor was without a doubt important for personal success, collective success and the development of everyone involved in the project.
